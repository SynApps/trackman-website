title: Trackman Beta Available in Heroku
author: SynApps

<h3>Giving devs control over maintenance and error pages</h3>
No one likes to maintain those pages, they are a pain for every developer...
<ul>
	<li>They are static and must be hosted elsewhere</li>
	<li>Their assets must be hosted and linked accordingly</li>
	<li>They force you to re-write and maintain separate css and js files </br> which, in most cases, are embedded in your html files</li>
	<li>They force you to perform 2 deployments when you change the layout of your website</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 0 20px"> Instead, why not... </h4>
<ul>
	<li>Version those pages with the rest of your app, including linked assets</li>
	<li>Let Trackman deploy everything when you do</li>
	<li>Those pages will now be served when needed (application error or maintenance mode)</li>
</ul>

We plan on offering <a href="https://addons.heroku.com/trackman"> the base plan </a> for a monthly price of a cup of coffee.

<h3>Supporting rails on heroku for now</h3>
<p>
	We have just released the public beta version on heroku.
	At this writing, we are rails 3.2 and 2.3.x ready.<br/>
	We support Ruby 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 Out-of-the-Box.
</p>
<p>
	However, we will gladly accept version <a href="https://github.com/SynApps/trackman/issues"> support requests </a> if they do not require an exhaustive refactoring.
