title: Trackman in private beta
author: Emanuel Petre

<h3>Giving devs control over maintenance and error pages</h3>
No one likes to maintain error and maintenance pages, they are a pain...
<ul>
	<li>Must be hosted elsewhere</li>
	<li>Assets must be synced with those pages</li>
	<li>You are force to re-write and maintain a separate css and js file (and in most cases they are embeded in your html files).</li>
</ul>

Instead why not...
<ul>
	<li>Version those pages with the rest of your app, including linked assets</li>
	<li>Let Trackman back them up when your app boots (first request after a push)</li>
	<li>Those pages will now be automatically served on application error or maintenance mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Work in progress</h3>
<p>
	We just released a private beta version on heroku.
	At this stage we are stabilizing the whole application 
	The application is rails 3.2 and 2 ready<br/>
	It supports ruby 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 out of the box.
</p>
<p>
	We are adding it to all our apps on heroku since we mainly did this tool to scratch our itch!
	Documentation can be found <a href="https://github.com/SynApps/trackman"> here </a>
</p>

<h3>No final release date yet</h3>
<p>
	We plan on spending around a month in private beta and if all goes well launch in August.
</p>

<h3>Plans</h3>
<p>
	We are also working on available plans for this addon, <br/> but you can expect the basic plan to be around 5$.
