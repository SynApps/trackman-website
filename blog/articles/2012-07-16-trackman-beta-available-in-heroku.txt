title: Trackman beta available in Heroku
author: SynApps

<h3>Giving devs control over maintenance and error pages</h3>
No one likes to maintain those maintenance pages, they are a pain...
<ul>
	<li>They are static and must be hosted elsewhere</li>
	<li>Their assets must be hosted and linked accordingly</li>
	<li>You are forced to re-write and maintain a separate css and js file (in most cases they are embeded in your html files).</li>
	<li>You have to do 2 deployments when you change the master layout of your website</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin: 0 0 0 20px"> Instead why not... </h4>
<ul>
	<li>Version those pages with the rest of your app, including linked assets</li>
	<li>Let Trackman back them up when your app boots (first request after a push)</li>
	<li>Those pages will now be automatically served on application error or maintenance mode.</li>
</ul>

We plan on selling this service for the price of a coffee per month.
